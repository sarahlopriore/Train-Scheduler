# Train-Scheduler

This project uses jQuery, firebase to store data, and the dateFns library.

The form at the bottom can be used to add new trains to the schedule.

The form allows users to specify; train name, destination, first train time, and frequency of trains.

New trains are added to the database and the database is used to update the train schedule table.
